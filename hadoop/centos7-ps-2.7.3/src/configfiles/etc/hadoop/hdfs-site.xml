  <property>
    <name>dfs.namenode.name.dir</name>
    <value>file:///opt/hadoop-usage/dfs/name</value>
    <description>Determines where on the local filesystem the DFS name node
        should store the name table(fsimage).  If this is a comma-delimited list
        of directories then the name table is replicated in all of the
        directories, for redundancy. </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>dfs.datanode.data.dir</name>
    <value>file:///opt/hadoop-usage/dfs/data</value>
    <description>Determines where on the local filesystem an DFS data node
    should store its blocks.  If this is a comma-delimited
    list of directories, then data will be stored in all named
    directories, typically on different devices. The directories should be tagged
    with corresponding storage types ([SSD]/[DISK]/[ARCHIVE]/[RAM_DISK]) for HDFS
    storage policies. The default storage type will be DISK if the directory does
    not have a storage type tagged explicitly. Directories that do not exist will
    be created if local filesystem permission allows.

  <property>
    <name>dfs.blocksize</name>
    <value>134217728</value>
    <description>
        The default block size for new files, in bytes.
        You can use the following suffix (case insensitive):
        k(kilo), m(mega), g(giga), t(tera), p(peta), e(exa) to specify the size (such as 128k, 512m, 1g, etc.),
        Or provide complete size in bytes (such as 134217728 for 128 MB).
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>dfs.hosts</name>
    <value></value>
    <description>Names a file that contains a list of hosts that are
    permitted to connect to the namenode. The full pathname of the file
    must be specified.  If the value is empty, all hosts are
    permitted.</description>
