  <property>
  <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
  <value>file:///</value>
  <description>The name of the default file system.  A URI whose
  scheme and authority determine the FileSystem implementation.  The
  uri's scheme determines the config property (fs.SCHEME.impl) naming
  the FileSystem implementation class.  The uri's authority is used to
  determine the host, port, etc. for a filesystem.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>io.file.buffer.size</name>
  <value>4096</value>
  <description>The size of buffer for use in sequence files.
  The size of this buffer should probably be a multiple of hardware
  page size (4096 on Intel x86), and it determines how much data is
  buffered during read and write operations.</description>

<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.quorum</name>
  <value>192.168.33.110,192.168.33.111,192.168.33.112</value>
  <description>
    A list of ZooKeeper server addresses, separated by commas, that are
    to be used by the ZKFailoverController in automatic failover.
  </description>
</property>
-->
<property>
  <name>ha.zookeeper.session-timeout.ms</name>
  <value>5000</value>
  <description>
    The session timeout to use when the ZKFC connects to ZooKeeper.
    Setting this value to a lower value implies that server crashes
    will be detected more quickly, but risks triggering failover too
    aggressively in the case of a transient error or network blip.
